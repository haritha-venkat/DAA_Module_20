# EX 2A BACKTRACKING - RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM
## DATE:

## AIM:
To implement the Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking and find all possible paths from the start to the destination in a given maze.


## Algorithm

1. Initialize a 4Ã—4 maze as a 2D list, where `1` indicates a valid path and `0` indicates a blocked cell.  
2. Define a helper function `isSafe` that checks whether the current cell `(x, y)` is within bounds and open (`maze[x][y] == 1`).  
3. Create a solution matrix `sol` initialized with all zeros to store the path taken by the rat.  
4. Start from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` and use a recursive function `solveMazeUtil` to explore the path.  
5. In `solveMazeUtil`, if the destination `(N-1, N-1)` is reached, mark it as part of the solution path and return `True`.  
6. If the current cell `(x, y)` is safe, mark it as part of the path in `sol[x][y] = 1`.  
7. Move forward recursively in the maze: first try moving down (`x + 1`) and then right (`y + 1`).  
8. If moving in both directions fails, backtrack by marking `sol[x][y] = 0` and return `False`.  
9. In the main function `solveMaze`, print the solution matrix if a path is found; otherwise, print that no solution exists.  
10. Call the `solveMaze` function with the initialized maze to start the process.
